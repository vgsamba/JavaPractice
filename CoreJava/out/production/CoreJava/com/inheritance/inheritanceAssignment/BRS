Scenario: In a company there are employees with two designations Manager and Trainee. Both employees share the same set of attributes and basic salary calculation logic is same but the basic salary of trainee and manager are different.
The Manager has a travel allowance equal to 15% of the basic salary, whereas all the other employees the travel allowance is 10% of the basic salary. Write a program to maintain the entities using inheritance.

Problem Statement 1:
1.	Create a class Employee with the following instance variables.

Instance variables 	Data type
employeeId	long
employeeName	String
employee Address	String
employee Phone	Long
basicSalary	double
specialAllowance	double  default value- 250.80
Hra	double,default value- 1000.50

2.	Create an overloaded constructor in the employee class, which takes the below constructor parameters and initializes them to their respective instance variables.

Constructor parameter	Instance Variable
Id	employeeId
Name	employeeName
address	employeeAddress
phone	employeePhone


3.	Create a method calculateSalary in which the basic salary needs to be calculated as below.

salary =  basicSalary + ( basicSalary * specialAllowance/100) + ( basicSalary * hra/100);
The calculated salary should be displayed in the console.
       NOTE: salary is a local variable.
4.	Create the sub classes Manager and Trainee with base class Employee. Create overloaded constructors which takes the below parameters and initializes them to their respective variables in the super class.

Constructor parameter	Instance Variable
id	employeeId
Name	employeeName
address	employeeAddress
phone	employeePhone
salary	basicSalary

5.	Create a class “InheritanceActivity.java” with a main method which performs the below functions,

Test case #1:
•	Create an instance of Manager class by calling the overloaded constructor with the below parameters,




Constructor parameter	Instance Variable
id	126534
Name	"Peter"
address	"Chennai India”
phone	237844
salary	65000

•	Invoke the calculateSalary method of the manager object.
The salary calculated should be printed in the console.


Test case #2:
•	Create an instance of Trainee class by calling the overloaded constructor with the below parameters,
Constructor parameter	Instance Variable
id	29846
Name	"Jack"
address	"Mumbai India”
phone	442085
salary	45000

•	Invoke the calculateSalary method of the trainee object.
The salary calculated should be printed in the console.

Problem Statement 2:
1.	Add a method called calculateTransportAllowance in Employee class which should calculate the transport allowance by calculating 10% (default allowance) of the salary. Print the salary after calculating.
transportAllowance = 10/100*basicSalary.

2.	For a manager, the transportation allowance is 15% of the basic salary. So override the calculateTransportAllowance method in Manager class which should calculate the transport allowance as 15% of the base salary. Print the salary after calculating.

transportAllowance = 15*basicSalary /100.

3.	For a trainee, the transport allowance is same as the default allowance; the method calculateTransportAllowance in the base class can be used.

4.	Invoke the calculateTransportAllowance for the manager and trainee class in the main method of  InheritanceActivity.java.
